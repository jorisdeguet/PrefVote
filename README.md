# PrefVote
This little project started with one goal, explain interactively how preferential voting works.

More precisely, how results are computed in preferential voting. 

How to vote is straightforward but if we do not understand how results are computed, it is hard to build trust.

See the demo here for ranked pairs : https://jorisdeguet.github.io/PrefVote/tideman.html
